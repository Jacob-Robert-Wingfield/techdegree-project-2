Basketball Stats Tool

I imported a copy of contants.py which contains the list of dictionaries of the players and their stats. Then I created a function which asks the user to input a number of 1 or 2 in a try block which asks whether they want to quit the program or display team stats. If they input 1 it will run the choose_team function, if they input 2 it will print a goodbye message and they will exit the program. The choose team function asks the user to choose a team from the three teams. Then this choice is ran through the display_stats function. The diplay_stats function then displays the total player amount and the name of each player on the teams. The roster of each team is determined by the balance_teams function shuffles the players and assigns the shuffled players one through six to the panthers team, six through twelve to the bandits, and twelve through eighteen to the warriors. Then at the end of display_stats it is displayed that the user must enter to continue the program again, which if pressed saves the teams from how they were shuffled previously so that they were the same. Otherwise it exits them.
